The techniques I'm working on here will factor into at least the next two renders that I post.  As for this one, it may or may not stay in the gallery long term.   Thought it looked interesting enough to share though:-)"

I thought they would make an interesting Lightwave macro render however. When I showed it to Jessie the first thing she said was \"oooh Nightshade!\" and that sounded like a great title to me.    It's not your garden variety that's for certain!\n   \n   Stay tuned for the landscape (rendering now on Shadowfax)!"

My night version dials back some of the clouds which gave the original its title but I think it still works.   I hope you enjoy it at least as much as a \"day\" version!"

    "description": "Glad to finally be able to post this one!   The Vue scene took so long to render that I feared that Shadowfax had hung more than once.   It actually did crash one time and I had to restart the whole thing.   Regardless, I persisted and I'm happy to be able to share it with you.  I used Lightwave 2018's new texturing model for the background planet.   Hopefully it was worth the wait.\n   The scene will need a major rework if I am going to be able to produce multiscreen versions however.  The whole thing is set up for 360 rendering but we shall see."

    "description": "It's been a few months since I've done a \"BIG\" landscape and some of you have been requesting them.  My recent scenes have been more on the intimate side. To be honest I've gotten myself into a bit of trouble using Vue lately in that the scenes I've been dreaming up have been taking far too long to render.   \n For this scene I wanted to concentrate on keeping the render time manageable (on Bucephalus even) while still keeping the WOW factor.   I hope you think I've succeeded with \"Strathwood\"."

This render is a texturing exercise, inspired by re-rendering the original Organelle from 2002  for VR.    The geometry here was modeled using The Plant Factory rather than Xfrog though.   I still have a lot to learn but I thought I would share my progress..."

I wasn't trying to model any real life organisms here, but rather create something fanciful and colorful.\n I'm not 100% happy with how everything turned out (after MANY days of rendering at 8K on Bucephalus) but I do think it looks nice enough to share while I consider revisions.

Ever since I started learning The Plant Factory I've had the idea to create a \"tree character\" and it seemed like Halloween was the right time to try it out.   The central figure and the \"hands\" were all created using Plant Factory and the scene was rendered using Vue.  \n        I almost didn't have it ready in time for 10/31 because my original version had some volumetric ground fog that I had to remove in order to shorten the render time.  Maybe I will be able to finish that version someday..."

    "description": "A few years ago we journeyed back to San Diego with the kids and visited Balboa Park one day.    There happened to be a dahlia exhibition and contest going on and I was simply amazed at the diversity, beauty and complexity of this type of flower.   I resolved to model one someday and here it is (with my own spin of course).  One last flower before winter sets in for 2017.   I modeled the blooms and set up the UVs in Plant Factory and finished the texturing in Lightwave."

    "description": "Jessie and I recently watched Ken Burns' and Lynn Novik's excellent \"Vietnam War\" documentary on PBS.   It was a gut-wrenching series and more than a little bit surreal to think how I wouldn't have Jess by my side if not for the war.   Throughout the series I was struck by the incredible beauty of the Vietnamese countryside.   It was that ethereal beauty which inspired this latest render, \"Peace in the Valley\"."

    "description": "This one is another Plant Factory experiment where I am attempting to vary the coloring of my leaves per individual tree.   Most Vue plants have one leaf color (and this look unconvincing in Autumn renders) but here I've created a tree with five different color \"zones\".   The bottom leaves are purplish, red above that, then orange, then yellow and green at the tops.     The Vue scene is a test of sorts to see how they look together in a \"natural\" setting.    Basically it's a doodle of sorts, but I thought it looked nice enough to share.   Let me know what you think!"

I've added the \"Autumn\" installment to the gallery today.   The sun angle is a bit lower, the clouds a bit darker, and I've added some seasonal flora (including a new thistle model that I created in TPF) to the foreground."

    "description": "This piece arose from a converstation I had with my boys while driving down to southern Illinois to witness last week's total solar eclipse.  We were talking about eclipses and how an eclipse would appear from the moon, with the sun covered by the Earth.   We see these as \"lunar eclipses\" here on Earth and basically the moon turns blood red for a couple of hours.   Why does it turn red?   Because the sunlight creates a bright red ring around the Earth as it passes through our atmosphere.    \n  As I was describing it I got to thinking that it would make for an interesting wallpaper.   I hope you enjoy the result.    If you are used to solar eclipse photos you will notice that the corona is smaller here.  This is because the Earth is larger than the moon and blocks more of it from being seen.   I realize the image looks a bit dark and featureless in thumbnail form but the larger versions in my gallery should show more detail."

    "description": "Growing up on the flat Illinois prairie I developed a healthy fascination with cumulonimbus clouds.  I often imagined that they were mountains in the distance, or that they concealed giants.   They were definitely the tallest structures to be seen in a world of distant horizons.  \n This piece continues my exploration of how to create these clouds using Vue d'Esprit.   I was going for a sunset look here, with the clouds lit from a low angle.   Hope you enjoy it!"

    "description": "I recently asked my fans on Facebook which of my \"classic\" images they would most like to see redone using my modern tools.   I received over 100 replies but would you believe not a single one of them requested I revisit \"Of All Places\" from 2007?    Regardless, I was trying out a new method for creating rocky structures using Zbrush and the revision sort of happened naturally.   \n  This scene departs from the original a bit in that it is set more in a rocky ravine than a dark cave.  I rendered the original using Lightwave but used Vue for this scene. I hope you like the update!"

I am often inspired by the beautiful nature images and every once in a while I try to recreate something from the calendar.   \n It so happens the May 2017 page features a lovely photo of sand dunes...     \n  I created this scene as an exercise to learn how to better use World Machine and the Geoglyph plugin.

    "description": "I've been working this scene since the middle of March, but Vue would always crash before finishing the render.  It was especially frustrating because it would render almost the entire image (taking days) before finally failing.  Trying to save the image would also result in a crash.  Many facepalms!  \n  Finally I decided to rebuild the entire thing from scratch and  (hallelujah) I was able to get it finished.  It is a continuation of the themes I started \"Exobotany\" and \"Vaulted\".  All of the foreground geometry was modeled using The Plant Factory.\n  I think it even looks a bit better than my original (glitchy) scene :-)\n   I hope you enjoy it.  Multiscreen versions coming soon!"

    "description": "I've been chasing that \"lit from below\" look with my clouds for some time now.   The best way to achieve it with Vue seems to be using the \"spherical\" render mode where your world becomes a sphere (instead of an infinite flat plane).  It makes for some incredible lighting options, but unfortunately everything seems to take 5 times as long to render.   For this scene I've rendered the sky as a background first (as I did with \"Skygate\") and then worked on the foreground as I would in the normal \"flat\" Vue scene. It was a lot easier to do preview renders this way :-)"

    "description": "The past couple of Vue renders I've attempted have been, shall we say, troubled.   Thinking that perhaps I have been jamming my scenes with too much complexity, I've been experimenting with breaking them up into foreground/background sections and then combining the elements so, hopefully, resources are economized and render-times are decreased.  \n \n In this case I rendered the \"sky plate\" first and then set it as a background object in new scene.  Both renders were created on my Bucephalus workstation while Shadowfax worked to complete another render."

    "description": "After finishing the day version multiscreen I hoped to transition immediately to creating the night version that I had planned.   Unfortunately my Vue d'Esprit software had other ideas.   As has happened quite a few times before, I wasn't able to re-open my scene file to continue working on the project.  After much swearing and gnashing of teeth, I managed to open an older version of the scene (without the vines) and rebuild things to where I could progress with my nocturnal version.\n \n  Unfortunately after rendering the single-screen version here Vue crashed and, once again, I wasn't able to reopen my work.   There are certainly a thing or two that I would like to tweak with this render but unfortunately that won't be possible unless I spend another whole day rebuilding it (yet again).   That also means the multiscreen version will be delayed.\n  Fortunately I think the render I do have looks nice enough to share.   Let me know what you think!"

    "description": "This one started out as a revisit of \"Planitia\" (which turns 10 years old this year!) using some of my custom-designed Plant Factory models.   The plants used some of the techniques I learned creating \"Dreams of Avarice\".\n It took an unholy long time to render on Shadowfax due to the all the SSS and refractive globes.    Somewhere about 2/3rds of the way through the render it occurred to me that perhaps the bottom of the screen was a bit on the busy side, but I let it finish rather than start over.\n Let me know what you think!"

This one took quite a long time to render on \"Bucephalus\" due to the volumetric fog.    For that reason I don't have a multiscreen ready right now.   \n Unfortunately when I saved this scene file Vue 2016 messed up a lot of the texture maps and it will be quite a chore to reset them all.

    "description": "I haven't worked with Apophysis (a \"2D\" fractal \"flame\" generator) in quite a while so I decided to boot it up on Asfaloth while two particularly lengthy renders were finishing on my desktop workstations.   I was particularly interested in the new \"3D\" features of the program and trying to emulate some of the incredible floral renders I've seen online.\n  This render doesn't quite look floral yet, but I think it looks interesting enough to share in my gallery while I keep learning.   Let me know what you think!"

    "description": "Merry Christmas!!\n I've never tried covering my trees in 3D snow before.   Up until now I've always used 2D tricks to give the illusion of a thin coating of snow on my meshes.   \n Here I used The Plant Factory to create trees with real(ish) clumps of snow.   Decorations were also created in Plant Factory.\n Of course, the technique could certainly be improved and I will be working to do so.   In the meantime be looking for a night version of this scene (and multiscreens) soon!"

I won't describe the scene further in case you haven't read it yet.   The scene describes one of the main characters approaching a fortress on a \"floating mountain\"."

    "description": "This piece started out as a learning exercise using Quadspinner's excellent \"Geoglyph\" plugin for World Machine.   The background mountains and foothills were modeled using this software.\n  Unfortunately my render bogged down unexpectedly around the 2/3rds mark and I paused it to work on another idea.   Unfortunately when I tried to reload this project the scene file failed to open.  Grrrrr!\n  Fortunately I had saved my render in progress and was able to use a few tricks to finish it off.   Unfortunately this means I don't have any scene data available to render a multiscreen, winter versions, further revisions, etc.\n  I hope you can enjoy it as is though!"

    "description": "While looking up at the stars one recent evening I had the idea that if you were to look directly down on someone floating on a calm sea at night, they might appear to be drifting in space.   I liked the idea so much that I paused my Autumn landscape render (which is very nearly finished) and set about crafting it.\n \"Cogito Ergo Sum\" (I think, therefore I am) is a companion piece of sorts to The Dreamer.  The boat and the boy are the same (though altered slightly for this scene). Where the action in that render takes place beneath the surface of the water, this piece uses a reflected sky.  I hope you enjoy it!"

    "description": "I modeled these trees using The Plant Factory as an exercise in varying the hue of the foliage on each individual model.   After all, an Autumn tree is rarely all one color.   \n I've used various tricks to replicate that effect in the past but this is the first time I've been able to create single model with multiple different colored leaves.    This should lead to ever more realistic Autumn landscapes in the future :-)\n I should have a few Pickle Jar versions to upload in the next few days but I will let this render stand alone for the time being.   I hope you enjoy it!!"

    "description": "Like many of you I was shocked and saddened to hear that one of my favorite artists, Prince, passed away suddenly on Thursday.   As a huge music fan and a lover of unbridled creativity in all its wonderful forms, losing Prince feels like someone turned down the lights a little on our world.   \n I've loved Prince's music since his \"Little Red Corvette\" days in the early 80s. One of the things that always most fascinated me about him was that he taught himself to play the piano (at age 7), the guitar (at age 13) and the drums (at 14). As a young person he gave me hope that I could teach myself to succeed creatively.\n If you've followed my work over the years you know that I try not let the world intrude into my gallery.   I've always wanted DB to be a place to escape the pains of real life.   This is an exception.\n I was working on this render when I heard the news Thursday and I immediately started adapting it to become a tribute to his genius. I hope you enjoy it. \n Rest in peace Prince!"

    "description": "Leonardo Bonacci (a.k.a. Fibonacci) was an Italian mathematician during the late 12th/early 13th century.  It was he who popularized the Hindu-Arabic system of numeration that we still use today.  He also gave us the famous \"Fibonacci Sequence\";  a series of numbers where each number is equal to the sum of the previous two before it. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, etc.\n The sequence appears throught nature in many ways.  The shell of the nautilus, the arrangement of leaves on a plant and  the number of petals in a flower is a good example.  The numbers form the \"Golden Ratio\".\n I created this flower in \"The Plant Factory\" using the Fibonacci sequence.   There are 377 outer petals, 233 in the next set inward,   144 and lastly 89 in the innermost ring.  The numbers are used in other ways too.   Hopefully the sequence will create a bit of extra subconscious realism.\n I rendered the scene using Vue d'Esprit.   Let me know what you think!"

    "description": "Now that I've gotten halfway decent at using The Plant Factory I have turned my attention to another one of my helper programs;  World Machine.   World Machine allows for the creation of detailed landmasses with realistic erosion and texturing (going far beyond what Vue offers natively).\n I've already created a few renders using World Machine (last year's \"Valley of the Sun\", \"Valley of the Stars\" and the \"Cliffs\" series) but now it's time to go deeper.\n I'm sure \"Castlemere\" will draw comparisons to \"Highland Spring\" (the elevated camera, the color scheme, etc) and that isn't entirely unintentional.   One big difference here is that I've populated the scene with deciduous vegetation (rather than evergreens) which will allow me to do a proper Autumn version when the time comes.\n I hope you enjoy the new render.  Let me know what you think!"

    "description": "I've been meaning to update my \"Trinity\" scene using Vue for a long time now but the trick was the figure out how to get two light sources to affect the coloring of the sky (Vue only allows for 1).   I think I've figured a good workaround using a volumetric light.\n I chose to use alien plants (modeled by myself using The Plant Factory) in the foreground this time and I've left out the little person.   Since the viewer was one piece of the eponymous \"Trinity\" I've chosen a new name for this piece.   \"Circumbinary\" is an astronomical term for a planet orbiting a binary star.\n Members might recognize white-dwarf as the same that has been my \"work-in-progress\" for the past month or so.    I've finally found a use for it ;-)"

This sheltered Midwestern farm boy was astonished to find fruit growing on trees during the \"dead of winter\" and this new render is my paean to \"stored sunlight\".\n  This one went through a few different versions before I chose to post anything and one of those early renditions is available for download in the Pickle Jar.  I haven't decided if I like the glowing plants in the water below the tree and they may be gone in the final version.   Let me know what you think!"

While waiting for two new Autumn renders to finish on Shadowfax and Bucephalus I went looking through my old Vue files for likely candidates for new print renders.\n That's when I came across this Autumn version of \"Untouched that I created way back in 2008 but for some reason never got around to rendering full-size.    Here's the scene rendered at 5K.   What do you think?   Pickle Jar or Gallery??"

    "description": "It occurred to me not long ago that while I have wallpapers for several holidays, I have neglected one very important holiday: Your Birthday. Now, I don't like to render food (or have it on my wallpaper) so I tried to think of something else.\n \n I hope you like what I came up with. I put it together on my laptop while Shadowfax rendered the first draft of another new Autumn piece I am working on.\n \n\n Of course I am posting it because it is my own birthday today (9-11). To celebrate I am offering the new wallpaper for FREE today for anyone else who shares my birthday (or has one coming up). Enjoy!"

    "description": "You never know when inspiration might strike.   I've been re-reading George R. R. Martin's \"A Clash of Kings\" recently.   Daenerys Targaryen sees many visions in the \"House of the Undying\" including one that I thought would make an interesting wallpaper...\n  \n  \"A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness...\"\n  Some think the flower symbolizes Jon Snow, and in his very next chapter he meets Ygritte who tells him the story of \"The Winter Rose\".   Connected?   Maybe. \n  I thought it would make a pretty cool wallpaper though and I hope you agree.   Let me know what you think!\n Here's a timelapse video showing how I created this piece...\n \n\n Subscribe to my YouTube channel to see more!"

I left the mountain mist intact however.\n The snowcaps are supposed to be lit by moonlight here, but I may need to practice that effect more with such wide-angle renders.  \n As before, I've chosen a single-screen area and cropped the multiscreen.

    "description": "With this new version of \"Ring of Fire (Night)\" I've replaced the \"fake\" glow of v.2 with \"real\" volumetric light.   The effect is a lot more immersive and creates a nice contrast with the moonlight.   Triple-screen users gets a bit of lightning on the right screen.\n This one took nearly 28 days to render on Bucephalus.   It simply wouldn't have been possible for me to produce this render without Shadowfax!"

    "description": "My first hi-res render using Mandelbulb 3D (not to be confused with Mandelbulber which I have used a few times before).\n In some areas it seems more powerful than the other app, but in others it isn't.  It's a 32-bit program, for example, so I can only use 2 GB of my 128 installed GB to process images.  This means some of the post-processing options (like DOF) run out of memory on large images.\n I still think it's worth learning though.   Let me know what you think of the first effort!"

    "description": "...Dany gasped.  They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one.  She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if were all solid stone.  The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, as as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun.  One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it.  Another was pale cream streaked with gold.  The last was black, as black as midnight yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls.  \"What are they?\" she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder\n        \"Dragon's eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai...\" -- Game of Thrones, by George R. R. Martin.\n      I've long been fascinated with the descriptions of the dragon's eggs in the world of \"The Song of Ice and Fire\".  Most of the ones I've seen represented IRL have huge scales but the description from the text says they are tiny.   I chalked this up to craftspeople maybe not having the ability to create tiny scales.  This is not a problem that I have on my computer however.\n   I created this scene on my mobile workstation while Bucephalus worked rendering another project.\n     Happy Easter!!"

    "description": "I had the opportunity recently to visit Arizona and take in some incredible natural beauty.   The desert in the south of the state is different from the desert in the north.  This render takes a bit from all of the different regions I visited, and adds a healthy dose of my own fancy.\n   \n   The landforms were modeled using World Machine and are the first such efforts to appear in my gallery.   Likewise, the cacti are my first original efforts modeled using \"The Plant Factory\". They appear at different levels-of-detail  throughout the scene.\n   \n   There are quite a few things I would like to change about this scene but I thought it looked nice enough to share as is and it has been too long since I've been able to update my gallery.  Just rendering at 4K took nearly 72 hours!\n  I first attempted a 5K render that went for 5 days being lost to an inadvertent reboot.  I re-rendered at 4K to save time so that is why I do not have a 5k version to offer at the moment.  Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste  \n As soon as this image is posted I will be shutting down Bucephalus, installing my new GTX 980 and swapping out my old Dell 3007 for as many of my new BenQ 4K panels as I can get to run.   I hope to have the rest of  Shadowfax assembled and in action within a week or so.  \n Since there are no consumer UHD+ 16:10 monitors, this might be the last render I create at that aspect ratio..."

    "description": "So many folks have requested a green Fluorescence for St. Paddy's day.   Why haven't I done it before?   Good question.   I just remembered because I wanted to use a green version of \"Fluorescence\" for my Facebook Page Profile Pic but saw to my chagrin that I didn't have one!\n  \n  Rather than simply shift the hue of the blue version using Photoshop I chose to re-shade and re-render the mushrooms using \"shamrock green\" (#009E60).   Since I went to all that trouble I thought I should probably post the wallpaper for my Members ;-)\n   \n  Please enjoy responsibly!!"

A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful.\" --  A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin\n \n I'm a huge \"Song of Ice and Fire\" fan and I've wanted to do a render of a \"heart tree\" for a long time.   I've posted a series of \"making of\" photos on my Instagram account if anyone is interested."

    "description": "This new version of \"Winterborn\" was inspired by the incredible macro-photography of Alexey Kljatov.   I used one of background ice crystals from the 2012 revision which all modelled using Incendia's Snowflake modeler. This particular flake was created when I was showing my son Jason how to do back when he was 6 years old (the shading is the hard part).   I created the threads in Xfrog and rendered the whole using Lightwave 11."

    "description": "I created the original \"Black Angel\" as a Halloween wallpaper but I was already thinking how interesting it might look as a winter scene.\n  I've used the same snow-covering technique that I first attempted in Hokkaido to cover the branches and vines with snow.   This scene, however, was considerably more complicated so the results were  not always perfect.\n  Inspired by the Black Angel in Iowa City's Oakland Cemetary, which I became familiar with during my time as an undergrad at the University of Iowa in the 90s."

    "description": "This is what happens when I try to recreate a lost abstract and end up going off on an entirely different tangent.   I somehow managed to erase my scene file for \"Infinitesimal\" before I was able to render the multiscreen version.   I still had the objects though so I set about trying to recreate it.  For whatever reason, though, I couldn't get it to look right.   I created a bit of new geometry then, thinking I would just create a new \"Infinitesimal\", but I was never able to get results that I felt were better than the gallery version.\n I decided, in the end, to scrap the revision and just create something new with my new geometry.   I hope you like the results!"

    "description": "Me back in 92 getting inspired for my latest #Halloween render. pic.twitter.com/Q4fY0rzY9V— Ryan Bliss (@dblasphemy) October 20, 2014\n   \n   The \"Black Angel of Oakland Cemetery in Iowa City always freaked me out as a college student back in the 90s.   As you can see from the photo above, I couldn't even look at it.\n   While the statue in Iowa was my main inspiration, I'm sure some of you will also think of Doctor Who when you see this render.   \n   Either way I hope you have a happy and safe Halloween!!\n  PS: Jessie took issue with my claiming the inspiration for this piece was the Black Angel in Iowa City. She correctly noted that our son Ian has been putting together a black angel costume for Halloween for the past month so he should get the credit. Thanks for the inspiration Ian!"

    "description": "I was never really happy with the clouds in my original \"Moonshadow\" render.   For this update I wanted to simulate a real \"moonshadow\" with the clouds (some still lit by the sun and some are in shadow).\n   \n   You may notice that quite a bit of this scene as adapted from \"The Green Flash\".   I put a lot of trial and error work into achieving those atmospheric/beach effects and I didn't want to re-invent the wheel for what would essentially be the same environment.  \n   \n   You can think of this piece as a companion to \"The Green Flash\" if you'd like, taking place a bit further up the beach ;-)\n   \n   As with the original Moonshadow, I'm sure a lot of people would prefer there be no human in this piece.   I may provide such a render later, once I am happy with the \"final\" settings.\n   \n  Let me know what you think!"

    "description": "The very first night I spent in San Diego (back in 98 or 99 I believe), I had dinner at a place in Pacific Beach called \"The Green Flash\".   The name intrigued me and I found at that the \"green flash\" refers to the green color the sun takes on just as the very last bit of it disappears below the horizon.\n I had the opportunity to return to San Diego recently to visit with old friends.   This wallpaper is my homage my old home in the west and the years I lived there.\n I used Vue d'Esprit's \"planetary\" mode to allow me to place clouds (and the sun) beneath the horizon line so I could create godbeams from beyond the curve of the earth.   Tricky to set up and it took forever to render (to clean up the noise) but you let me know if was worth it."

My goal was to create a believable galaxy in Lightwave using the new instancing tools (and no Hypervoxels).   \n \n This one rendered in around 90 minutes at 4800 x 3000 with 24 anti-aliasing passes.   That certainly beats the 24 hours that a similar Hypervoxel render would take.   I'm still learning all the tricks to the new instancing system so this is just the beginning.\n \n Let me know what you think!  \n \n PS:  The title refers back to this piece from 2001."

    "description": "After all that tinkering with Vue's planetary rendering mode, I thought I should bring it all together was a nice planetscape.  \n  The planets are a combination of two different Vue renders (it only lets you render one planet at a time) and the foreground was also rendered using Vue 2014.\n You might detect the influence of my recent trip to Washington state.\n  Here's the original from 1998 if you are curious as to how they match up!   I hope you like the update!!"

    "description": "On the plane back from Rustycon I had an idea to improve 2009's lowest rated \n render.  It's always bugged me that I wasn't able to make \n that one work.   As soon as I got back to Bucephalus I fired up my trusty copy \n of Vue 11 and set about making a few improvements.\n Here's the version I am most pleased with at the moment.   \n I've raised the water level a bit, added some snow the \n surrounding rocks (inspired by snowy vistas I recently flew over) \n and about a thousand other tweaks.   I also have a more \n \"fantastic\" version that I may add to the Pickle Jar later which \n was certainly inspired by my time at Rustycon...\n Let me know what you think!"

    "description": "I was recently asked how I spent my birthday. I told her I spent \n   the day working and she looked at me sideways as if to say \n   \"That's Too Bad\". Actually I can't think of a better way to spend \n   my birthday.\n   \n   I spent that day creating the pieces for this scene in LightWave 3D and then I \n   assembled them using Vue \n   d'Esprit. The scene has been rattling around in my head for a \n   long while after seeing a random photograph online. \n   \n   This piece is dedicated to Jessie's Mom and \n   Dad. We visited them recently and were blown away by their incredible hanging \n   garden. Seeing their handbuilt creation inspired me to \n   finally create the geometry.\n   \n   I hope you enjoy it!!\n Here's a page with all of the different seasons."

Don't be surprised if I do a \n few different renders of this particular system."

    "description": "It was my original intention to create a night scene for \"Sakura\" that used some of the same \"bio-luminescence\" from \"Satori\". I played around with quite a few different textures on the petals (see the blue Pickle Jar version here).\n \n The results, however, were underwhelming. The idea struck me as I was falling asleep one night to light the scene from beneath and that's when I thought up the floating lanterns. \n Fortunately I remembered my idea the next morning. I modeled the lanterns in Lightwave, imported them to my scene and set up the lights. I have to admit that my first test renders really took my breath away.\n \n I hope you like the results!   I almost prefer this one to the day version...\n BTW:  The character on the lanterns translates to \"cherry blossom\"."

    "description": "Around where I live we are still waiting impatiently for Spring \n  to arrive.   I've gotten so tired of the cold and gloom that I \n  thought it would be therapeutic to create a new Spring wallpaper.\n  I've added \"Sakura \n  (2013)\" to the Members \n  Gallery this morning.  I've wanted to update this piece for a \n  long time, due to the fact that the cherry blossoms on the 2006 trees are actually 2D \n  planes that lose detail closer to the camera.\n  Vue 11's new \"360 Ecosystems\" finally allows me to create a \n  proper flowering tree using 3D blooms.   I've used this tech so \n  far to create Christmas lights and a few glowing blooms but this \n  is my first attempt at Chery trees.   This render itself is \n  actually a \"first draft\" and there are a few aspects that I would \n  still like to tweak, but I thought it came out nice enough to \n  share while I render my revisions.\n  If you are curious, the scene contains over 98 billion \n  polygons and took over 38 hours to render at 4096 x 2560.   I'm \n  hoping to cut down the render time for future versions.\n  Let me know what you think in the comments.   I hope you like \n  it!!"

    "description": "A Member recently wrote...\n \n \"Would it be possible to do an abstract at some point that is \n more minimalist? Generally I love the incredible amount of detail \n that is everywhere in your work, but for some types of wallpapers \n (mobile mostly) I prefer things which are towards the minimalist \n side, and abstracts seem like the perfect place for that.\" \n \n I decided to try it out so I put together something very quickly, \n very \"minimally\", in Lightwave.   I only used Lightwave's \n \"Textured Environment\" for this piece, no geometry at all, and I \n previewed it for my Members a couple of days ago.   The feedback \n was generally positive so I kept tinkering.  \n This \"finished\" version is a bit more complex \n than I had originally intended but the construction is still \n fairly minimalist.   I added a single 2D plane and some \n volumetric lights so it is technically a \"3D wallpaper\". \n All in all it was a fun exercise and nice to render something \n that only takes 30 min instead of 30 hours.   I will try to have \n a multiscreen up shortly along with some of the early versions.   \n Hope you enjoy it!!"

    "description": "A number of folks were perplexed by the planets that I added to \n my 2013 \"Singularity\" \n update.   The original did fine without them, but I \n added them to this scene because I wanted to try a \"from the \n ground\" render.\n That render took Vue a little longer than I had anticipated \n (84 hrs!) but it is complete and now available to my Members.  I'm calling this one \"Singularity Rising\" (for now) bit that \n may change as I make some revisions.\n I hope the issues that were pointed out for \"Singularity\" are \n minimized in this planetary render.   Perhaps I will go back and \n render a version without the planets?"

    "description": "A lot of folks have been asking me if I could create a new St. \n Patrick's Day wallpaer, and I thought it would be fun to do a \n night version of my \"Cloverscape\" sort of in the same mode as my \n \"Pandora\" version of \n \"Satori\".\n I've zoomed in quite a bit on the four-leaf clover from the \n original scene and gotten a bit fanciful with the lightning.    A \n lot of people never noticed the four-leaf clover in the 2010 \n version so perhaps this will help point the way.\n Hope you enjoy it!!  The title, by the way, is borrowed from \n my 2001 Lightwave render \n but you'll probably agree that the two images are quite \n different."

    "description": "If you read J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" you will see references made to the long history of the Middle Earth.   This history is laid out in a book called \"The Silmarillion\".\n   \n   Here's the short version:  \n   \n   The first beings were the \"Valar\", and were analagous to the demi-gods of Earth mythology.   They walked under dark skies without Sun or Moon however.   \n   \n   Iluvatar (the Supreme Being) made many attempts to illuminate the world, but these were opposed by Melkor (who was the forebearer of Sauron).   The first light was made by two massive lamps on either end of the world, but these were cast down and destroyed by Melkor.\n   \n   The second attempt came in the form of two brilliant trees which shone over the Valinor.   The silver tree was called \"Telperion\" and seeds taken from it eventually grew into the White Tree of Gondor.  The gold tree was called Laurelin.  A shining dew fell from the each tree which the Valar collected in wells.   \n   \n   The light of the Two Trees was captured in three brilliant jewels called \"Silmarils\" which afterwards became the source of much fighting and discord.\n   \n   These were eventually poisoned and destroyed by Melkor with the help of a massive spider (and ancestor of Shelob) but they have always captured my imagination.  \n   \n   As always, I took quite a few liberties with this piece but I hope it is enjoyable even if you aren't familiar with the history of Middle-Earth.\n  I've added a free 1024 x 1024 version on Reddit."

    "description": "You may have noticed the Da Vinci quote at the top of my Works-In-Progress page which reads \"Art is \n  never finished, only abandoned\".   Here is another render which \n  proves this axiom.\n  \n  I opened up my \"Cobalt Daisy\" scene \n  file (created using Lightwave 7 back in 2002)in Lightwave 11 with \n  the intention of rendering out the original in separate layers \n  for an upcoming mobile project.   When I had finished with that, \n  however, I couldn't resist the temptation to tweak some of my \n  textures.   A few hours later this was the result...\n  \n  I posted it on my Facebook Page \n  last night and asked folks what I should do with it.  The \n  majority said I should post it in the gallery so here it is.\n  \n  Dedicated to my wife Jessica.   October 12, 2012 is our 10 \n  year wedding anniversary and this piece was originally created 10 \n  years ago.   Te amo!"

Time to remedy that!   \n    \n    Here's one for the astronomy geeks out there.  As I am sure \n  they \n    already know, a \"Magnetar\" is a \n   special type of neutron star with \n    an extremely powerful magnetic field.  My representation is a \n   bit \n    on the fanciful side, but I hope I mananged capture the \n  violence \n    and dark energy of such a body.\n  I modeled most of this using a new program called \"Incendia\".   \n I \n  hope you like the results!"

It sounded like a great idea to me, \n  but unfortunately my first version took far too long to render \n  for me to considered doing even a multiscreen.   \n  \n  In the end I decided to tear down the slow-rendering version and \n  figure out how to process it quicker.   I finally found the \n  answer (NO PROCEDURAL TERRAINS!) and was able to produce a well-\n  received multiscreen version as well as this night render.\n  \n  I'm not sure this is going to be the final version of the night \n  scene, but I thought it looked nice enough to share.

    "description": "I would just like to say thanks to everyone for the kind words \n posted here and on my Facebook account regarding the recent loss of my \n father.    I am still reeling from all of this but it helps that \n my four brothers and my sister are all together now sharing \n stories and laughing/crying through our memories.  \n The saddest part of all of this, for me, is thinking about \n what my two boys are going to miss out on.  I feel like I am \n greiving for the three us.   Seven years ago my wife and I made \n the decision to move our family from sunny San Diego back to my \n hometown in Illinois so my kids could grow up with two \n grandparents around.  Rather than rue the past however, I will \n try to be thankful for the few years we did have together.   \n One thing that I always knew about my Dad was that he loved to \n make things, whether it be music, painting, or Christmas presents \n for his grandkids.  He loved telling stories.  \n I would like to think that his creative spirit will live on in \n my work.  I am looking forward to sharing some of his paintings \n with you in the weeks ahead.  \n I've been working on this project for the past week or so and \n the render finally finished yesterday.   Now I haven't decided if \n I am truly finished with it or not, but I thought it looked nice \n enough to post as is.  I am not sure when I will be able to pick \n up work on it again.\n I had thought to dedicate this to my father, but decided \n against it.   I will create something more fitting in the future.   \n Thanks again to everyone for the condolenses and prayers."

    "description": "This is a sequel of sorts to Enshrouded which I have put together to test \n out \n  Vue d'Esprit 10's \"Advanced Cloud Modulation\" techniques.  \n  Basically it allows me to contour the cloud layer to the \n curve \n  of the terrain, so they appear to drape naturally over the \n  landscape.   It's a tricky procedure which I hope will be made \n  simpler in future versions of Vue (so I don't have to height \n maps \n  in Photoshop hopefully). It is a powerful tool however, and one \n which I hope will bear more fruits in the future.\n  Your thoughts?"

    "description": "On Christmas day 2011 DB Member \"Puritania\" asked if I could possibly complete my Gotham Garden seasonal series by adding a winter version.  \n It took me about a year to get back to it but I am happy to report winter has finally come to Gotham.  The changes needed for winter are a bit more complicated than for the warmer seasons but I think it turned out pretty well.  \n I hope you enjoy it.   I will try to have the multiscreen up shortly!"

    "description": "Happy Holidays!   This is, of course, an update to my \"Blue Christmas\" which I rendered first using World Builder in 1999, then again using Lightwave in 2002.   This is my first version using Vue d'Esprit.\n      \nIt would be an understatement to say that this was a difficult render to produce.   Without getting too technical I will just say that you can really get yourself into trouble by cranking up the quality settings in Vue.  Also, I've found the new version of Vue doesn't even begin to accurately estimate the render time remaining.\n      \nFortunately I was able to finish the render (though I had to restart it a few times) and I think it turned out pretty well.   I do see a few things I would like to tweak but I might wait until after the Holidays to do any re-renders.  The sad thing is that even after all this time, this render is really only my first hi-res draft.   Better to post what I have though and fix it later.."

    "description": "On December 2nd I was sitting and waiting for a render to finish \n which I decided it would be fun to do an \"IAMA\" (Ask me Anything) \n on Reddit.com.  Redditor \n \"poker_face\" asked if I could \"draw\" a Reddit Alien (TM).  My \n answer was \"We'll See\", which was taken to mean no.\n      As my kids know, \"We'll See\" can sometimes mean yes.   I \n had a such a nice visit with the Reddit community that I thought \n it was the least I could do to try my hand that the iconic Alien.\n      Most Redditors seemed to know me from my \"Fluorescence\" mushrooms \n so I thought it would be fun to combine the two. Especially since \n my Christmas render is still churning. I roughed this out \n and rendered it on my third-string workstation using Lightwave \n 10.   \n \n     This one is dedicated specifically to Redditor \"Rethread\".  \n As requested:  Something \"warm and fuzzy\" for the Redditors."

    "description": "I've always loved underwater scenes and was thrilled to learn that Vue 10 had a new water rendering engine.   I worked on this scene for about a week and it's gone through quite a few different revisions.  Light and color behave differently underwater and this has been a learning experience for me.\n   This was my latest render and I would say that I am around 80% happy with it.   I started in to fixing the last 19% when tragedy struck.  Vue crashed and for some strange reason refused to reopen my scene file.   The backup appears to be corrupted too.   I'm glad my kids were at school when that happened because I get in trouble when I swear in front of them.\n   Anyway,  the first file was lost so I worked over the weekend rebuilding it.   I've changed a thing or two since the original (which can be found in the Pickle Jar).  I've moved some things around and added some more sea life to the scene (the title has changed accordingly).   \n  Hope you enjoy it!   I look forward to many more underwater scenes with the new Vue render engine!\n PS3 Dynamic Theme Available!"

    "description": "This one is a \"mental photograph\" of sorts.  I was driving on an eastern Iowa freeway in mid-Sept 2011 when I looked to my right and saw a green, summer-like, wooded area with this one blazing red tree sticking out like a torch.   I only glimpsed the scene for about 5 seconds, but I thought it would make an interesting wallpaper.   I fired up Vue when I got home and constructed this scene from memory (with a bit of artistic license).  I hope you like it!\n  \n  The third and fourth versions I rendered deviate a bit from my initial inspiration.  The second version looked very much like what I saw on the roadside, but I wanted to try something a little more subtle.  Vue doesn't allow you to vary the leaf color on a \"per-branch\" level so I rendered a few different shades and composited them in Photoshop."

I thought it would be a fun project to make my own version of the scene and this is the result.   Now, it isn't a complete copy.   I didn't have the photo open in another window while I was working on it, but it was definitely inspired by the NatGeo photo however."

    "description": "I didn't really set out to update Cosmic Shoals when I started this project.  Rather I set out to model a globular cluster (and some of that is still in the image) but the story \"grew in the telling\". \n  Technical note:  In the past I have used Zbrush for \"landforms\" such as these (see \"Circumpolar) but this time I chose to use Vue's built in \"symmetrical terrains\".   By adjusting the clipping range you can make all sorts of interesting shapes without the memory overhead of importing .OBJs. \n     Jessie told me this one reminded her of some of my earlier work, and I tend to think this is because of the lack of any vegetation or the other objects I tend to scatter around using Vue's ecosystems.   I tried adding some \"alien flora\" here and there but nothing seemed to look right (given the scale of the scene).   I may yet play around with that but I thought it looked nice enough to share as is.   Hope you enjoy it!"

    "description": "When I was working on \"Phraxis\" back in 2009 I came to the point (which I do with all of my space projects) where I had to decide if I was going to keep it a \"space render\" (as seen outside the window of a space ship) or a \"planetary render\" (as seen from the ground).   I had already finished the space scene so I whipped up a quick and dirty scene to see what a view from the ground would look like.   I decided to post the space render and moved on with my life.\n  After switching my workstation over to Bucephalus in June 2011 I was looking through my old hard disk for projects to revisit (mostly old multiscreens that I neglected to render).   I found my old \"planetary\" version of Phraxis and decided to post it in the Pickle Jar.   \n  The reaction was so positive that I decided to spend a few more hours and flesh out the rough scene so it could have its own place in my gallery.

    "description": "\"The comet's tail spread across the dawn, a red slash that bled above the crags of Dragonstone like a wound...\" -- A Clash of Kings (Prologue)\n \n After seeing the season finale of HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" I was inspired to revisit my Harbinger wallpaper and create a new version for fans of the series (and myself) who are waiting impatiently for season 2. This one depicts the blood red comet that hangs ominously over all of the happenings in Westeros during the second book.\n \n The blue Harbinger was the first wallpaper I worked on after a long, very arduous, hospital stay in 2009.   Reading \"Clash of Kings\" during that time was truly one of my few joys at the time.\n I had originally posted this in my Pickle Jar, but the reaction was so positive that I decided it had earned a place in my gallery.\n Valar Morghulis!"

    "description": "My first project designed and rendered entirely on my new workstation (Bucephalus). Thanks to all the Members and people who pitched in (over $3000) so I could work on such an insane tower of technology!   \n   After the Chaiten volcano in Patagonia erupted a lot of people sent me pictures of lightning in the ash cloud and asked if I could do something similar.  .    I received more photos last year after the Eyjafjallajökull eruption. At long last the new version of \"Vue d'Esprit\" (9.5) adds the ability to limit clouds to a certain area, freeing me to make all sorts of \"cloud sculptures\".\n        This one started as a thunderstorm but as I was working on it I was reminded of the volcano and decided to go in that direction.\n        My son Ian drew me a picture of this scene and suggested that I call it \"Death Mountain\".  I suppose that works too.  In the end I decided to call this one \"Dødenfell\" because it is a Norse(-ish) word meaning \"Death Mountain\"."

    "description": "After I posted \"Tropic of \n     Thetis\" it was suggested that a night version might include \n     some bio-luminescence in the water.  This is my third version \n    of \n     the night scene.   In the earlier versions(available in the Pickle Jar) I played around with the brightness of the clouds and the amount of haze.   This version is more like the first, with the brighter clouds, a bit more haze, and the bio-luminescence shifted to the orange (away from pink).   \n   I've also added some 'glowing foam' in the surf.

    "description": "A Member asked recently \n why I hadn't made an Easter picture since 2003 and I didn't have \n an answer.   I guess I thought I had made as good an Easter Egg \n picture with the \n original Ostereier as I could possibly do.   \n Anyway, I recently tried to open up my 2003 scene file (to do \n a higher res render) and was horrified to see that some of my egg \n objects were missing.   As I looked at the incomplete scene I \n started playing with a few of the eggs that were left and after a \n while I guess I had redone them all.\n The resulting render is a little on the trippy side, but it is \n 4/20 after all...\n Hope you like it!"

    "description": "Free Version \n Here\nThe Bliss family is \n big into PopCap games and no game \n gets more play than \"Plants vs Zombies\".  \n My kids (especially Jason) love it so much that I thought it \n would be a good way to show them \"what Daddy does for a \n living\". \n          They watched me model the plants, position, shade and \n render them.  Of course they wanted me to add more and more \n different plants, but I think I we will save those for future \n scenes.\n        \n         Since this isn't a 100% Ryan Bliss original, I have \n decided to post a (lower res) free version \n here.  DB \n Members can find all \n of the available resolutions here.\n         I hope the folks over at PopCap enjoy my homage.  The \n title is a line from the \"Zombies on your Lawn\" theme song.

For whatever reason it had been a quite a long time since I've tried anything \"magical\".  After reading \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" to my 7-year old son Ian, doing a little CRPG gaming, and purchasing a new version of Lightwave the time seemed right to dust off my spellbook in Winter 2011.\n   \n   For the record:  The figure in the center of the \"magic\" was Ian's idea."

    "description": "\"Highland Spring\" is one of my most complicated scenes (it contains hundreds of billions of polygons) so adding realistic clouds for a summer version really knocked the render times through the roof.   \n I tried to mitigate this with my first attempt by making the clouds fairly opaque (the more you can see through the clouds the longer the render), but the final effect wasn't quite up to par with the original.\n Back to the drawing board and, two weeks of render time later, I've posted my final version of \"Highland Summer\" this morning.   I've tried to make the clouds more wispy and \"fog-like\" and I've strengthened the shadows from the higher cloud level.   The clouds, I think, are the most realistic I've attempted to render (detail crop here).\n It feels strange posting a summer picture while the leaves are falling outside my window, but I'm sure my fans down-under will under enjoy a timely seasonal wallpaper for a change.   I will try to get the multiscreen version of this going ASAP, but it will probably be a while.  More renderers would speed up this process for me...\n The first two renders will remain in the Pickle Jar for your perusal."

    "description": "\"What does it mean???\".  After seeing Hungry Bear's video for the umpteenth time I was inspired to whip up a \"quick 'n dirty\" wallpaper so I could have a double-rainbow on my desktop.   My a href=\"http://digitalblasphemy.com/picklejar.shtml?i=doublerainbow3&mode=dir\">initial version looked something like a \"Double Rainbow over Death Valley\".\n  For the second revision I took the scene out of the desert and added some more foliage.  Finally I added some foreground water to reflect the rainbow(s).  You can see the early versions in the Pickle Jar\n    The Bear seemed to take a lot of heat for his exuberance, but I think it's great that he is enjoying all that nature has to offer."

    "description": "I created this image as an ode to the time I spent fishing with my son Ian after he broke his arm in the spring of 2010.  We had just taken the training wheels off of his bike 4 weeks prior and he thought he had acquired enough skill to pull off some radical skid maneuvers.  Unfortunately pavement can be a harsh instructor. \n   We transitioned to fishing and had a very mellow spring.   I'll never forget it.  I rendered this image using Vue d'Esprit.  It's one of my first large scenes to use Vue's built-in DOF blur."

    "description": "The last in my Canopy Creek seasonal series.  I was going for an early spring look here (since the summer version is pretty lush) and this is the first time I attempted leaf buds.  Basically in Vue this means erasing the leaf alpha down so only a little nub shows.  I think the effect is pretty convincing."

    "description": "The first inspiration for this piece was a passage I read in \"Best Served Cold\",  by Joe Abercrombie.  Except the paragraph described looking up through a valley.   I created the valley geometry using Geocontrol and then placed my Vue d'Esprit camera at the bottom of the scene.  After a few mediocre renders I decided to move the camera to the top of the valley, turn it around, and look down.\n I was as blown away as some of the comments below when I saw the render.  I added the water and colored it to match some photos a good friend of mine had taken at Glacier National Park.  I had always been taken by the almost turquoise water in those pics and had wanted to include it in one of my scenes. \n The foreground tree was a tough call for me.  I wanted something in the foreground to give the scene a sense of distance and scale, but I didn't want it to distract from the scene.  I think it worked out well however.  This is the only one of my images to rate over 9 after 2 weeks.\n I hope to create fall and winter versions at a later date."

    "description": "Dedicated to my wife Jessica.\n   I try to do at least one Christmas wallpaper a year. It's been a tradition since I first started DB. After depicting mostly secular icons for many years I felt inspired this time to explore the Christian aspects of the holiday. \n   I was at Ian's school \"Holiday\" concert recently and was disappointed that many of the songs I sang as a child (O' Holy Night, Silent Night, The First Noel, etc) were no where to be found.   I'd never heard most of the ones they chose.\n  I think whether you are a believer or not I think there are a lot of beautiful songs, art, and traditions to be found in the Mass of Christ. \n   The tale of the Magi always captured my imagination as a child and I hope you enjoy my depiction.\n   Order Cards!\n      \n \"Magi\" Card by digitalblasphemy \n See more Holiday Cards"

It was Ian and Jason's first and they had a great time (we had my green laser pointer to play with between meteors).  When I was a kid my mom used to wake me and my brother to watch shooting stars.  I've been fascinated by the night sky ever since.\n   This wallpaper is dedicated to that night in 2010 with my boys, the nights to come, and those nights many years ago.

    "description": "This piece started with Vue d'Esprit's atmosphere editor.  I put together a great sky and then I worked to create a scene to go with it.  First I tried an ocean scene, but later settled on a forest.  The volumetric fog in this scene is quite expensive to render, so I am having a hard time producing a multi-screen render.  I still run the multi-screen render on my alternate box when I have no other more pressing projects, but it is very slow going."

Because the plates are 2D they are relatively fast to render.\n  Next I would like to try mixing the 2D fractals with 3D volumetrics. . ."

    "description": "Created this piece during a very tough time in my life.  My son \n  Jason fell mysteriously ill in early 2010 and eventually had to \n  spend 4 days in the Children's Hospital.  Oncologists were \n  involved so it was pretty scare for all of us.   Fortunately it \n  turned out to be a particularly nasty viral/bacterial infection \n  and he was fine.\n      I fashioned this one out of the Muspelheim sun during a 48 hour stretch while \n  Jessie stayed at the hospital and I stayed with Ian.  It was a \n  great stress release I must admit.\n     I'm very excited about the cool space effects possible from \n  melding Apophysis fractals with 3D geometry."

    "description": "I really wanted to give Vue d'Esprit's clouds a workout here.   They had just come out with a new version which allowed clouds to cast shadows on each other (something which, believe it or not, wasn't possible before).   This image actually started out as clouds only but I added the forest late in the process to give everything a sense of scale.  This image took an absurd amount of time to render (over 10 days) so I had to wait until I purchased a new workstation in May 2011 until I could devote the rendertime needed to produce the multiscreen.   I finally finished it in Sept 2011 after a staggering 1000 hour render."

    "description": "This is a very special image to me.   I created it while recuperating from major abdominal surgery in early 2009 and in a way this represents my own personal phoenix.  \n    I was re-reading George R.R. Martin's \"Clash of Kings\" at the time and a blood-red comet figures prominently in the story.  The cyclical, returning, nature of the comet really inspired me.\n  The comet was created and rendered in Apophysis and composed in Lightwave into a sky-spanning \"planet\" plate for Vue d'Esprit.\n Updated 6/22/11:  I've added a blood-red version of this image (for Ice and Fire fans) in the Pickle Jar!"

    "description": "I created this piece after reading George R.R. Martin's \"Dying of the Light\" in 2009 and I was honestly a bit surprised that it shot to the top of my most highly rated images.   The process might sound complicated by it was actually pretty simple and the whole project only took a few days. The nova was rendered first as a series of Apophysis plates, then imported into Lightwave and arranged to form a pleasing supernova.   The planets were added and the whole thing rendered to another plate which I used as a sky-spanning \"planet\" object in Vue d'Esprit.   The landscape is pretty old-school for me (with no crazy Ecosystems).  It all came together very nicely however and I hope to have a print version up as soon as I can figure out how to render the clouds convincingly at high-res."

    "description": "This was my first attempt to craft more detailed Vue d'Esprit trees by building the branches themselves out of individual Vue tree models.   I edited them in the Solid Growth editor to get them to bend the right way and then I places them around a central trunk.\n   The effect was pretty convincing, except in this case I didn't set up the \"branches\" so they all intersected the trunk.   This precluded a winter version of this scene because the disconnects would be visible.   Perhaps I will come back to it and try to work something out.   I have an autumn version here and would love to try a winter scene someday."

I learned from my first mistake however and made sure the branches all intersected the trunk.   That made possible this leafless Winter version.  It is my personal favorite of the series."

    "description": "This image is a follow-up to Green and Gold.   The tree is the same and because each branch is an individual Vue tree object I can color the leaves on one branch differently that the others.   I had always been dissatisfied with the control Vue gives over the leaf coloration on a tree-by-tree basis and this is the best workaround that I've found thus far."

    "description": "This is a night version of my 2008 \"Citadel\" update.  Here's the original I rendered in Bryce way back in 1998.\n I hadn't been able to finish the multiscreen version back in 2008 due to a bug in how Vue 8 rendered clouds when you change the aspect ratio.   In the summer of 2011 I opened the file in Vue d'Esprit 9.5 and saw that the bug was fixed.   It took my alternate box nearly a month but I was able to finally finish the multiscreen render.\n It looked so much better than the Vue 8 version that I have replaced the single-screen with the new render as well."

    "description": "I turned 30 on 9/11. The birthday call from my Mom (which woke me \n     at around 6:30 Pacific time) was the very definition of a rude \n     awakening. By that afternoon the requests were coming in for a \n    US \n     Flag wallpaper.   I had posted \"September Rose\" before going to bed on Sept \n   10.\n       \n       I recall that the folks at \"The Screensavers\" on TechTV used \n     this wallpaper for quite a while during the fall of '01. After \n    it \n     went up I received hundreds of requests of different flags of \n    the \n     world. Flags aren't really what I do, but I had to make an \n     exception this one time. It was simply the most horrible day \n  in \n     modern memory.\n      Reactions to this piece have been, shall we say, \"mixed\" \n    over \n     the past 10 years.   I religiously avoid discussion of \n   political \n     matters on this site but when your country calls you have you \n     have to respond.  The many many thanks I have received from \n  the \n     men and women in uniform have been all the validation I will \n    ever require."

    "description": "My first stab at using a pre-rendered background in World Builder.   The aurora and stars were rendered in Lightwave first.\n \n I created this piece from the memory of an occasion I had driving in northern Michigan during the mid-90s.   It was the first time I had ever seen the Aurora and, due to our relatively southern latitude, the famous \"ribbons\" were below the horizon.   The sky looked like a shimmering curtain beaming up from the horizon and I was transfixed.   I've tried to approximate that effect with this render."

    "description": "Shibaozhai: Created 1/22/99 using Bryce 3D, and Zenstar's Tree Druid plugin for Ray Dream Studio.  After seeing the incredibly realistic work of Bills Munns, I decided to try my hand at rendering an actual place. \n    Shibaozhai means \"stone treasure stronghold\" in Chinese.  I was watching a special on \"The Learning Channel\" called \"Lost Treasures of the Yangtze\", where I saw this temple.  The temple is built directly into a solid rock face overlooking the river.\n    This temple will most likely be underwater when the Chinese government succeeds in damming the Yangtze.  Plans are in the works to build a giant wall around the temple, so that it will actually sit in the middle of the swollen river.  The likelihood of this actually happening, however, is uncertain.  There are many many treasures that will be lost forever when the waters rise and flood the Three Gorges.  Read more about it on Wikipedia.\n    Either way, this is my first render of a real world location.  I've taken some liberties (of course), but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.  \n    \n    Metacreations Image of the Day -- 1/29/99"

Fast preview will render quickly (a relative term), but will not be high quality even with anti-aliasing turned on (and Fine Art anti-aliasing has no effect in this mode).  Turn off fast preview when you are doing your final render.\n \n If you enable Fine Art anti-aliasing, be prepared for a wait.  The image above, for example, rendered in under one hour at 1152 x 864 (PII300, 96 MB), with normal anti-aliasing.  When I turned on the Fine Art, the render time jumped to 8 hours (I rendered it while I was away at work)."
